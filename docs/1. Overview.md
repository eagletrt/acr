# Overview
Tool to collect data fron track-walks before races.
With a raspberry and a GPS connected to it, ACR allows to log cones positions.

The tracks are defined by cones of different types, each having its own meaning: blue, yellow, small orange and big orange cones.

This tool servs the purpouse to collect the cones types and positions and also to collect a continuous log of the position.  
**Cones positions** are mainly used as groundtruth for the driverless team, specifically for testing the perception algorithms.
**Trajectory** used by DMT team to extrapolate the outer and inner track limits, to then implement the lap time algorithms.
